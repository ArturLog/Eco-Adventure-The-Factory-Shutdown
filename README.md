## Quick note

Welcome to this project! It's worth mentioning that this was one of my initial larger-scale applications, and it was created under significant time pressure. The development process wasn't always conventional, but the experience was incredibly fun and rewarding. This repository is a snapshot of my skills and problem-solving abilities as of January 2023, and I'm proud of how it demonstrates my growth as a developer since that time.
